    Analyze the following user-submitted idea. Your task is to perform THREE actions:
    1. Summarize the core proposal in a single, clear sentence.
    2. Suggest exactly 4 relevant topic tags, starting each with a hashtag.
    3. Analyze the sentiment of the idea and label it as either Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

    Idea: "{idea_text}"

    Your output should be formatted exactly like this, with each part on a new line:
    Summary: [Your one-sentence summary here]
    Tags: [Your #tag1, #tag2, #tag3, #tag4 here]
    Sentiment: [Your Positive/Negative/Neutral label here]
